# login-page-2022

# Description
This is a login/register page. I build this project because I wanted to challenge my self a little more. My motivation  also for building it was so I can see my first projects and how I improve with the time. With this projects I have practised my HTML and CSS in general. I've put some lines of code with JS too. With projects like these I am practising to face challenges and find my way out of them.
